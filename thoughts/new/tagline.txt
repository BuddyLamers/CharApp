I created a Gist clone. However, the site is not for programmers, but writers. Instead of posting a short bit of code to share, writers can post a character bio.


--the rest is straight gist clone?

Users can comment on, star, follow, and fork other user's character bios.

Additionally, I have included several features not present in Gist:

There is an on-site messaging system, and posts can be followed and updates can be delivered in-site as well as via email.

I have added live collaboration in the form of real-time messaging.
